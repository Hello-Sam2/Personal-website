        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p class="more-p">Wade, after winning the Easter Egg, discovers a technology unreleased by James Halliday known as the ONI. He soon discovers how it will change the world and his life for the better, as well as the unexpected consequences of unforeseen dangers. The book travels through Wade's relationships in the real world, while also exploring the dangers of the virtual world. </p>

        <h2>How I discovered the book:</h2>
        <p>I discovered this book after reading the first book of the series, Ready Player One, which was also turned into a movie (which I did not like).</p>

        <h2>My Thoughts:</h2>
        <p>Wow, wow, wow I didn't think it was possible but it was even better than the first one. Kept me up at night reading for hours on end. Finished the entire book in 3 days. </p>

        <h2>What I liked about it?</h2>
        <p>A very compelling story where you're constantly rooting for Wade to get back his relationships and win the fight against the complicated antagonist, Anorak.</p>

        <h2>What I didn't like about it?</h2>
        <p>Nothing to see here...</p>

        <h2>Who would like it?</h2>
        <p>Especially those interested in sci-fi and fantasy, but really anyone. Reading the first book is completely necessary, the movie does not cut it for backstory.</p>

            <h1><strong>Action and<br>Thoughtlessness </strong></h1>
            <p>"All movements come out of emptiness" - Bruce Lee. The kind of emptiness is what you define, from a black void, to a calm mind, emptiness is not one-sided. And that's where we start.

                    <h1>üí®Emptiness.</h1>
                    <p>No matter the setting. Whether small possibilites or large, emptiness is always involved. It is inextricably connected to action. And, I find it fascinating how emptiness also connects most forms of enlightenment or nirvana. The final purpose of mediatation is not to empty your mind of thoughts, but to clear the unnecessary judgements of thoughts. While Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee's "final evolution" had more to do with the emptiness of the pre-emptiveness. He became in-tune with the movement enough to do it not just without thinking, but <em>without.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>I know this all sounds like some mystical voodoo shit at the moment, but I promise it has modern implications. While nirvana may not <em>actually</em>exist, it remains a place to look towards. A Garden of Eden, per se. So, since we are focusing on action, lets adress the connection and cultivate better emptiness. As you probably know, our brains are quite fast at doing just about everything. This is good most of the time, but it also allows for super quick repititions of the same detrimental patterns. Don't understand? Here's an example:</p>
                    <p>You are walking down the street, you see a help-wanted sign in a store. Then, your brain starts through the motions. </p>
                    <p>1. Initial Perception: Are you looking for a job? Do you want a job? Do you want a job at this store? </p>
                    <p>2. First Decision: I don't need a job that bad, I don't even have a resume on me, or anything, plus, I'm not wearing nice clothes. </p>
                    <p>3. Rationalization: Yeah, I'm sure that sign is a mistake, and I bet the person inside just took the job they needed.</p>
                    <p>4. Action, or lack thereof: Walks by feeling only slightly regretful. </p>

                    <h1>‚öñÔ∏èJudgement + Rationalization</h1>
                    <p>The largest issue with this process is the third step. This judgement is the sole reason for mediation. In all situations, whether initial perceptions of someone, or reflections on a situation, strong judgements are incredibly detrimental. They forbid a possibility of any other thing, thus one may not be able to enjoy a person's company if they have a view on them which is set in stone. When acting, make sure to not make a raationalization, because you shall come to regret it; but unfortunately regret only comes from reflection.</p>
                    <p>Getting back on track here, if one moves from emptiness, they will not be able to judge the outcome before it even happens. In most cases (like anything except jumping off a cliff) you just have to act, because the worst thing that can happen is always miniscule. Through the process above, all of us make this tiny possibility into the only one, and prevent us from even trying and receiving a great oppuritunity.</p>

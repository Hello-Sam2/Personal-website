            <h1><strong>The big Questions and<br>Reflection </strong></h1>
            <p>Personally, I've been trying to move away from the mindset of self-improvement, as I'm reading more into Pema Chodron's book, "When Things Fall Apart." But, reflection does not only have to be about being better than your previous self. In fact, it can help you immensley on stripping away layers in the future, which is a way of self-betterment, but in the correct context. 
            </p>

            <h1>The Problem with BIG Reflections</h1>
            <p>When reflecting over a lot of time, you must also plan in a great scale. So, ideas such as the Oddysey Plan, which is a tactic that makes you predict what may happen five years from now. The catch: there are three paths. On one, you act as if nothing changes from the path you are on now, another is if you took the detour you always wanted to, and the third, the path where money and societal expectations mean nothing. The pressing issue is, at least for me, the next five years are so incredibly different from the last, that I have no idea where to start. It is too daunting. So, is this even the right way to do things? I have an answer.</p>

            <h1>Appreciation and Reflection</h1>
            <p>Mindfulness. No that's not my answer though it is important. It has many definitions but at its bare bones, all it is is living in the present. It might sound cheesy, but when was the last time you weren't worried about the past or the future? You might think just now, what were you doing? Listening to music? Why? Was it to escape the thoughts about the future? I'd wager to say yes. I will not say that I am some meditation master for I am becoming more and more guilty of immediately covering up thoughts as well. The crux of this, before ever thinking five years in the future, one must refckon with their present state <em>first</em>. How do you go about this? Try going back to the micro.</p>

            <h1>Micro and macro</h1>
            <p>Remember your daily review? The one where you wrote that short story ever day. Yeah, that one? What are the problems with just doing that on a larger scale? There is honestly not that much wrong with it. I came into this day thinking I would pump out some great vision of the results of my hard work in the next five years. What I truly got was an unsatisfying answer which is that I can't fathom even the next month. Furthermore, how distorted will it be when I string together sixty unknowns? So, you've read this far, what can you do in that large review. For starters, you'll want to look back at your monthly reviews and get a sense of what you've done. If that reminder is all you need to feel fulfilled, for sometimes that is for me, great! If you're like me and still on the self-improvement train, try looking at the present again.</p>

            <h1>Yes the present <em>is</em> a gift.</h1>
            <p>How do you feel about the past x time period. No I don't want you to describe it in three words, for everyone enrolled in a school knows the annoyance of that. After looking at your accomplishments, are you feeling proud or empty or angry or sad or in despair or are you having an existential crisis? So, the true point you've all been waiting for is that the present is the key to both the past and the future, but there's no keyhole, so give up trying to unlock it. Damn. I'm gonna start quoting myself soon! Just kidding. -SB <a href="https://www.sendfox.com/samsblog"> Does this sound interesting?

            <h1>Learning & Improvement</h1>
            <h2>ü§îCreating a "LifeOS" in Notion</h2>
            <p>About 6 months ago, I started using an app known as notion, at first to take notes, and then basically to organize my life. Notion geeks call this their "LifeOS.</p> 
            <p>And since the New Year, I have been rethinking the way I think about goals. This also goes along with periodic reviews and updates I perform in the app.</p>
            <p>This the app that let me start doing this blog and the newsletter (which if you're not signed up to then what are you doing?).</p>
            <h2>üìïFollowing the 5 Hour Rule</h2>
            <p>The 5 Hour Rule was aa concept I ran into sometime last year (yes I know that's very vague). Essentially, it means you should attempt to learn for 5 hours per week by whatever means possible. To me this is mostly through books and podcasts.</p>
            <p>This is how I get content for my newsletter and just generally learn more. It also made me more interested in podcasts, I've been going through the archives of the Rich Roll podcast for the past few weeks. Tune in to this Sunday's newsletter to find out what I've been listening to.</p>
            <h1>‚ô•Health & Fitness</h1>
            <h2>ü•ãGetting my 2nd Degree Black Belt</h2>
            <p>This has essentially been my compass for the past year. It still seems far out, I'm not even sure if I will be allowed to take the test for it in June, but I will try my best to be ready.</p>
            <p>For this, I need to get back into running, which I'm doing now, and I need to go to more classes, which I have also been doing. It will be quite dissapointing if I will be unable to go for it in June, but if that's the case, I will certaintly get it as soon as possible.</p>
            <h1>üñ•Personal Brand</h1>
            <h2>üìßSending out a newsletter every week</h2>
            <p>So far, this has been consistent. It is mostly accountability for learning every week, and finding things worthwhile to share with other people. The whole experiment is based off accountability, I have goals I want to accomplish, so sharing them and not improving, will make you feel worse than if you were the only one who knew about them, hope that made sense.</p>
            <h2>‚úçWriting a Blog Post Every Week</h2>
            <p>I have kept this up, but this week is the first true test. Since I did not finish a book, which was an easy post for me. This post is the first in a journey of getting better at writing about me in general, for the blog in the future.</p>
            <h1>‚úåÔ∏èRelationships</h1>
            <p>I generally wanted to become more extraverted this year, and I think I have made progress on it (I guess you guys can tell me though). It's cerataintly related to confidence (like writing this post), but also focusing less on external motivations.</p>
            <p>Maybe I'm generalizing, but when thinking about what others think, you are always less confident. By relinquishing control to other people, whatever you thought you could change is no longer the same. You can control your actions, but once you make your thoughts related to others opinions, you have just moved whatever the thing is out of your locus of control. I know this is quite a tangient, but it's important to me.</p>
            <h1>üß†Final thoughts</h1>
            <p>This is certaintly not an expansive list of all of my goals, there are some which I shall not disclose. But, I think this gives you a general idea of where I'm aiming right now. I would love for you to tune in next month to make sure I made progress (especially on the black belt goal), and if not, feel free to shoot me an email!<br> -<br> Sam</p>
            <p>P.S. I really want to know about the formatting of this website, especially the font, and if you think it can be improved. I'm trying to work on my sense of design, which is extremely important for everything on the internet. So, if you have any ideas, please shoot me an email at 23Samuelb@lrei.org <br> Thanks!</p>

            <h1><strong>My New and Improved<br>Monthly Reflection </strong></h1>
            <p>As I learn more about mindfulness, I am continually questioning the idea of self-improvement in general. It was the obvious reason for me to start doing reflections as they help you better. But, then why is reflection such a big part of mindfulness? This is how I've deciphered it.

                <h1>The beginning</h1>
                <p>As you may know, I've already covered monthly reviews <a href="https://www.samuelbeacher.online/reviews-2.html">here.</a> But, since, then I've come upon a lot of realizations. I'm not saying that previous system was bad by any means, quite the opposite, but if the goal is not only for self-improvement, a lot can be accomplished on the mindful front. </p>

                <h1>The After-Beginning</h1>
                <p>Guess what, I still have goals! I haven't become a stoic master without the want to be better. Just because I know self-improvement can corrupt your life, doesn't mean I'm gonna erase all traces of it. For one, that's impossible, and two, I don't want to. Some things just work well with it, like running for example. Just remember not to base your self-worth on whether or not you continue to improve. Other than that, continue normally, review what you have done in the past month, and write an action point for next month. </p>

                <h1>Continuation...</h1>
                <p>So far, this has been a pretty boring blog post. But, don't worry, here's some real insights! First question: <em>How do you feel about the last month?</em> Feel free to write your heart out because this exercise might only work for one time. Now, after you've wrote your dissatisfaction with the complete and utter waste of time you had, or your contentment with where you are, stop and reflect, on the reflection. What do you think about it? Why were you dissatisfied? Was there an inner dialogue immediately saying you didn't accomplish enough, or replaying your regrets? Was there sadness because you lost an oppuritunity? Okay. What's Next? </p>

                <h1>Pretty meta right?</h1>
                <p>This interplay between your moods is part of a Buddhist concept known as the eight worldly dharmas. We have the loss/gain, fame/disgrace, pain/pleasure, and praise/blame. When something happens that's out of your control, most go through a dialogue and end up on one of these two sides. So, what would happen if you took the middle path. Not some figuratively less walked path, though it could be, but just the absense of either mood. This is a truly key principle of Buddhism, <em>just seeing/noticing</em>. Taking everything as it is, without expectation or fervor, just seeing. So, going back to your answer to the previous question, let's use mine as an example. I felt that this past month was incredibly busy and that some events clouded over others. I am also happy with the progression of most of my goals, despite the stubborn few that don't seem to move. So, what does this mean in context of the eight worldly dharmas? Well:</p>

                <h1>Nice Example!</h1>
                <p>Most of the thoughts on goals fall into the loss/gain principle. If I don't progress, it can feel like lost time, that I haven't gained any progress. But, there is surely some deeper motivation here, like my deeper why. Maybe some want of fame and fear of disgrace not just from others if I don't complete my goals, in fact mostly from myself. Now, redo the exercise except attempt to walk the middle path. Go through the same answers, how do I feel about the goal progression this month? Just dsee what happens in your mind. Do you think about a success? Or a failure? Or a setback? Do you think of the dissapointment you have or the lack of knowledge you've gained, or do you just sit there, content with what you have achieved. All of these can be explored but the most important part is to not forget them nor the exercise. Every month do this again, but hold onto the principle known as the beginner's mind. Have the curiosity of a child when they might do something. So, each time the new month rolls around, add this question to your monthly experiment, cause that's all life is right? A series of short and long experiments.  </p>

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>Welp, I hope this cleared something up. I like writing this as I go, so it's not fully planned out. This can lead to some slight grammar issues, but is otherwise better as it exploreds multiple different topics and has somewhat of a storyline. Key takeaways: Before noticing, everyone plays a dialogue between one of the four sets of opposites. After noticing, the dialogues begins to diminish, until one can just feel or just see what has ocurred. Two, look at everything with as much of a beginner's mind as possible, be as curious about x as you were the first time. <a href="https://www.sendfox.com/samsblog">Sound interesting?

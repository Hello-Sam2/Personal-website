            <h1><strong>Finding Your<br> Deeper Why</strong></h1>
            <p>Many insist that your deeper purpose must be put on a pedestal; that it is not necessary to think of daily. But, especially in exercise, quite the opposite is true, without a purpose, you are not working towards anything for one, and when you need motivation, you can't turn to others, you must turn to yourself. This is why one must find their deeper, WHY.

            <h1>ü§îWhat is a deeper WHY?</h1>
            <p>A purpose is something that comes internally to think of whenever in the toughest situations. Moreover, it is found by continually asking "why" three times. First, you find a surface level motivation. The easiest application for this is working out, no matter the sport, but works best for endurance events like long-distance running, or anything where one might feel lost. I started with the question,</p>
            <blockquote><hr>"Why do I practice martial arts?" and ,"why am I trying to run longer distances?"</blockquote>

            <p>Don't worry if the answers take a while to come, this process is not a one day thing. I ended up settling on the principle of never giving up. After some further reflection, I realized this wasa just as surface level as, "being a good role model," or , "trying to spend more time in nature." So, how do we take this farther?</p>
            
            <h1>üèóThe second level</h1>
            <p>Now that we have the first purpose, you start asking, "why?" If you ever want to find out the extent of a problem, situation, or just annoy someone, continually ask why until there's no answer. The deeper purpose is the same thing except once you get to the point of there being no clear answer, you reflect until there is one deeper.</p>
            <p>Going off of my purpose, why do I want to never give up. Well, I immediately gravitate to martial arts. One of the core principles is said as such, and so I then think of the black belt test and the rabbit hole goes deeper. Anyways, the reason why I want to never give up is part selfish and part externally motivated. For one, I want to prove to myself I am better than last time, going slightly farther, or, always improving. The other part is I want to show other people that I will never give up, and I'm sure there is some aspect of wanting to be "worthy" or as good as them because of that.</p>

            <h1>üß†The Third Level</h1>
            <p>Get ready for some more self-reflection on my part. Yay! So, the deeper purpose has now become, "I want to prove to myself and show other's that I won't give up." You know where we're going from here, "why?".</p>
            <p>Now we get into the truly introspective part. At this point, the purpose should become centered internally, so there is no need for someone else to support you. Now, for the answer, this is around the point where I'm still formulating what to think. There is surely a feeling of inadequacy, as there is for all wanting of external validation. Not exactly sure how that fits into why, but it's certaintly important to acknowledge. As for the self-improvement aspect, that goes into feelings of self-doubt, especially after the situations I've been in, notably my knee surgery.</p>

            <p>Will I ever be able to go back to what I did? Will I be afraid? So, what does this all mean? The next reason why is, "Because if I don't continually improve, I feel inadequate in relationship to my past self and others."</p>
            
            <h1>So what happen's now?</h1>
            <p>First of all, one year ago there's no way I would have posted something like this on the internet, not that anyone's really gonna see this but, you get the point. Anyways, the next step is to ask why one more time and see what happens. Whether nothing else comes for a year or you figure out another answer, the reflection is the most important part. Even if this doesn't seem to apply to you, there is enough to be gained in just reflecting.<a href="reviews.html"> It is getting more difficult to just sit with your thoughts, not necessarily meditatingm but deepening your understand of yourself.

            <h1>Final, Final Thoughts</h1>
            <p>As you can tell, this is still a work in progress, and that's okay, I hope this didn't feel too rambly, because this was totally me writing eveything that popped into my head on the page. So yeah, three things to take away.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Find a surface level reason why you do something, exercise, work, if you can't find one, do you really want to do [the thing]?</li>
                <li>2. Ask why, at least three times, or until you hit the wall.</li>
                <li>3. Sit with the wall, and try to find out where your deeper why goes from there.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's it, now all you have to do is think of your deeper why! This post was sort of like my journaling/reflection posted in a public place which serves multiple goals, seeking discomfort, building the blog, and writing. If you have any comments, which I would appreciate, do you want to see more of these, and et cetera, email me at 23Samuelb@lrei.org, üòä.</p>

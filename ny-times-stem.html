            <h1 class="times-t">Why We Can't Just Plant And Rant</h1>
            <p> &emsp;The amazon rainforest is the most biodiverse place in the world. It encompasses around 2.3 million square miles of land. Furthermore, every year over .1 percent of it is gone. You might be unimpressed. .1 percent is certainly not a lot, but when considered in terms of the Amazon, it means 2300 square miles of it is lost each year. That is as if over 7 New York Cities were being destroyed every year. Of course, over 8 million people live in New York City, which would be much more devastating, right? Well, considering the Amazon is home to millions of species (and thus hundreds of millions, probably billions) of animals and plants, thousands unknown to us, it is quite devastating.</p>
            <p> &emsp;You might have heard of Ecosia, a search engine that plants trees based on its customer’s searches. They have planted over 100 million trees since inception; that’s great, but not good enough to save our planet. Planting Trees Won’t Save the World, a New York Times Op-Ed, puts the truth eloquently: 
            
            </p>
            <blockquote class="nytimes-q"> <HR>“The focus must shift from treating climate change as a ‘global carbon’ problem to a ‘carbon pollution’ problem.” <HR> </blockquote>
            <p>In other words, a single, slow leak (carbon pollution) can be helped with a bucket (trees), but even this one leak, unlike the pipe burst faced today, will eventually overflow the bucket.</p>
                
            <p>Unfortunately, the only way to truly slow human-produced climate change is through policy. Policies like carbon taxes and clean energy infrastructure must be implemented. The only way to win this war and, </p>
            <blockquote class="nytimes-q"> <HR> “save us and future generations from paying a huge price in dollars, lives and damage to nature is rapid and substantial reductions in carbon emissions from fossil fuels, to net-zero by 2050.” <HR> </blockquote>
            <p><strong>So, this all seems pretty straightforward; why isn't this getting done? The answer lies in years of chosen ignorance and, ranting.</strong></p>
        
            <p> &emsp;The Paris Climate Agreement was a pact signed by 195 nations in 2015 to reduce carbon emissions drastically. It was an excellent framework to work off of but unfortunately countries have spent more time ranting than acting, and are not nearly on track with the lofty goals. The US is also off course after former President Trump decided the Paris Agreement was not for the his country: “pledging... to ‘cancel’ the Paris agreement.” Not addressing the climate crisis is almost wholly an issue for the future. Many communities around the world depend on fossil fuels. However, if these communities do not switch their livelihoods, they will cease to exist. Ignorance is bliss until the consequences are real.</p>

             <p> &emsp;Why more people can agree to plant trees than to institute carbon taxes is an extremely complicated question, but becoming, ”net-zero carbon by 2050” is the only way to address the imminent climate crisis. The fact that Planting Trees Won’t Save the World is an opinion article is a disgrace; <strong>It is a fact, not an opinion.</strong> As put plainly,</p>

        <h1><strong>Interests</strong></h1>
            <ol>I am incredibly interested in becoming an environmental scientist and the climate in general. In Eighth Grade for the Social Justice Project, my group focused on coral bleaching and its effects on our world.</ol>
            <ol>I am also an athlete in martial arts, participating in many competitions statewide. I recently had to get ACL Reconstructive surgery and am currently 6 months post-op. It was definitely a difficult experience but ultimately made me appreciate things I had taken for granted.</ol>
            <ol>Among my other interests are drawing, baking, skateboarding, practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricking_%28martial_arts%29"><em>tricking</em></a> and running.</ol>

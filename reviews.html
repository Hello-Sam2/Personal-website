            <h1><strong>Daily Journaling<br>Morning & Evening </strong></h1>
            <p>Ever since the new year, I have been journaling daily to chronicle the progress on my goals and my life. <br> This is what I've learned so far.</p>

                <h2>Daily Journaling</h2>
                <p>üìñJournaling daily is super important for remembering what you've done over the long term. But, there are also many benefits to your mental health, and as Bruce Lee said, journaling can</p>
                <blockquote> <hr>"keep your mind on the things you want, and off those you don't". <hr></blockquote>
                <h2>üåûMorning Journals</h2>
                <p> Here are the three main elements of the first journal of the day, there are 3 main ones:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Affirmations</li>
                    <li>Gratitude</li>
                    <li>Beginning the day</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I'll go through each of these in detail starting with #1.</p>
                <video  width="512px" height="512px" controls>
                    <source src="journal-record.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;">Here is a scrollthrough of all the days I've journaled for.</p>
                <p>Affirmations. You've probably heard of them and dismissed it as some voodoo. I will be here to say, you're not entirely wrong. It does sometimes seem odd to write, "you are confident". Which is why you won't be doing that. Affirmations are as much about improving the journey as they are about solidifying the end result. So, you might write, "I will be confident when x happens". Or you might write, "I will be <em>more</em>  confident by x date".</p>
                <blockquote><hr>Remember, in affirmations and most things, the most important thing is, "the perspective you hold in the execution of them". <hr> </blockquote>
                <p>Onto gratitude, something else you might have dismissed as voodoo. Well, I will admit, I still hold some of that opinion. I am certaintly not the person to talk to about them but, you don't want to just say, my shelter, my access to food. You want to put some implement and reason behind the sentence. "I am grateful for the privileged situation I live in that allows me to buy whatever food I want". If you don't want to try it, that's fine with me, but just start with one. </p>
                <p>Remember, if you move even 1 mile per day, you will have a compeltely different perspective in a year. If you don't move at all, not only will there be no progress, but your perspective will stay the same. </p>
                <p>Finally, general preparations for the day. These are much more personal. But in my case, I write about the one thing I want to accopmlish that day, preferably relating to my main goals (which we will get into in the weekly review section). Importantly, if you complete this one thing you set out to do, no matter what else happens, your day was successful. There is plenty more to add to your morning journal, but the only other thing I find necessary is a dream journal. </p>
                <p>Dreams can guide you and attune you more to your subconsious, which, if you want to be more aware of life, is probably a good idea.</p>
                <p>A note on consistency, I do sometimes miss the morning journal every now and then during the weekdays. But, I always make sure to do the evening journal, or more specifically, the short story of the day. What's that? See below.</p>
                <h2>üåùEvening Journaling</h2>
                <p>If you are to take anything away from this article, it is to write a "short story" of each day. Essentially, you take an interesting part of your day and write it down. That's it. Some tricks to help, it is preferable for the activity to be mundane or repetitive, but then on this day something special happened when you did that. It could be a first, seeing a friend for the first time in a while. Essentially, anything that creates a seperation between that day and all others.</p>
                <p>Remarkably, when I look back on past stories, I remember them all individually, and it makes me realize all the seperate days and things I've done in the past months, when they can sometimes go by fast. </p>
                <p>Other than the short story, there are three more important ideas to include in the Evening Review:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Three wins of the day</li>
                    <li>One thing I learned</li> 
                    <li>Did I progress on one of my main goals (plus specifics)</li>
                   
                </ol>
                <p>Starting with the three wins of the day, sometimes you have a bad day. You feel like you did absolutely nothing, or you felt terrible. No matter the case, you can find three things that happened which were good. This never fails to bring up my spirits.</p>
                <p>Then, the second most important concept, is the one thing you learned. I'm not too stressed on learning some crazy new concept every day. But I aim for 2-3 concepts per week. Whether this comes from podcasts, reading, <a href="https://www.sendfox.com/samsblog">or from MY NEWSLETTER (Which will help you immensely with your reviews! Click anywhere here to join the newsletter, and remember to confirm your email!)</a>It is also important to keep a database of what you learn each week (want to know how to do this, tune in next week for the weekly review post!). Yeah, never stop learning!</p>
                <p>Finally, the main goals. For me, I do have a seperate question about if I progressed on at least one, but I also have seperate spots to write on my focuses. For example, I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone more, so I have a question, "Did you seek discomfort today". Not only does this leave a place to show my improvement, but it also reminds me to keep exiting your comfort zone if you didn't for that day.</p>

                <h2>ü§îClosing Thoughts:</h2>
                <p>Wow. I thought this was going to be a short and sweet post about all the reviews I've been doing. But it looks like you'll have to wait untill next week to find out about weekly and monthly reviews.</p>
                <p>Importantly, the broader reviews are essential to finding what your main goals are and the systems you choose to track them with. As I have said already, please follow my newsletter for content to listen to, and possible templates coming out for daily, weekly, and monthly reviews!</p>

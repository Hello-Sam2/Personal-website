        <h2>Thoughts:</h2>
        <p>Overall, it was some good bread, but not necessarily baguettes. The recipe was pretty good though I made a few mistakes, my technique can always be better.</p>

        <h2>How I discovered the recipe:</h2>
        <p>Chef John from Food Wishes.com with...</p>

        <h2>What I liked about it?</h2>
        <p>It does give a slightly different crust than a regular bread. If you are not so good at kneading, this is the recipe for you. </p>

        <h2>What I didn't like about it?</h2>
        <p>Not much bad about the recipe itself, just remember to trust Chef John, and weight everything in grams if it is shown in the recipe.</p>

        <h2>Who would like it?</h2>
        <p>Anyone who has made some bread and wants to make baguettes or a more advanced recipe, this is a good starting point.</p>

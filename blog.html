                                <p>Wow. That's all I have to say about this book. This is the sequel in the trilogy starting with The Initiation. I literally could not put this book down, everything was so intruiging, the characters and storyline, incredible. Do yourself a favor and read this entire series, if not just for the ending of this book.</a></p>

                        <p>My second attempt at making baguettes! This recipe was from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDq5v10l4wkV5-ZBIJJFbzQ">Ethan Chlebowski</a>. This one turned it out incredibly delicious! They tasted and more amazingly, felt like baguettes. If you have any interest in making bread, this is a recipe that you must do. Please watch the video and subscribe so you can see if I top these in the next and last installment de mon emission!!

                        <p>This is the third book I have read by James Clavell. It is much shorter than some of his other books, and has a great ending! Click anywhere here to see my thoughts. </a></p>

                        <p>Wow, this book is so great in so many ways. The setting of the story is impeccable, the time period, the houses, the thoughts. There are so many characters and such an intricate story, yet somehow everything is given context without noticing it until you realize how important that is. You go from knowing nothing about Japan, to the intricacies of 30 years of feudal history.

                        <p>In the culmination of a trilogy, all the characters we know and love are seamlessly brought back together. When all hope might be lost, Neal somehow brings us back with a glimmer of hope. The intricate storylines are all separately engaging and developing until the very end where the even the Thunderhead's story-arch is completed. This book surprised me up until the very end from the unexpected twists and turns to the suspenseful chapters. </p>

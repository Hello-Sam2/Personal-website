        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Wow, this book is so great in so many ways. The setting of the story is impeccable, the time period, the houses, the thoughts. There are so many characters and such an intricate story, yet somehow everything is given context without noticing it until you realize how important that is. You go from knowing nothing about Japan, to the intricacies of 30 years of feudal history. 

            And the ending! It just reminds the reader of truly how complicated and intertwining the plot is.</p>
         <h2>How I discovered the book:</h2>
        <p>After reading Tai-Pan.</p>
        
        <h2>My Thoughts:</h2>
        <p>I loved it, much better than Tai-Pan. I'm not exactly sure why, but the story and characters were much more compelling.</p>
        <h2>What I liked about it?</h2>
        <p>I loved it, much better than Tai-Pan. I'm not exactly sure why, but the story and characters were much more compelling.</p>
        
        <h2>What I didn't like about it?</h2>
        <p>I don't hate to say it, nothing to see here.</p>

        <h2>Who would like it?</h2>
        <p>You should ideally be interested in history [of japan], and able to read a long book. Get ready to lost track of hours in this book. </p>

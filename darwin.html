            <h2>Firstly, why read Darwin's Unfinished Symphony?</h2>
            <p>While at first it might seem to be an outlandishly complicated explanation of why animal's copy or a slew of other things. Well, if you ever wonder anything about human evolution, this book will indulge you. Whether the evolution of language or culture, Laland manages to bring in many scientific topics to become simpler. This especially shines through the social learning competition.</p>
            <p>So, let's get into it.</p>   
            <h1><strong>Chapter 2: The beginning of the beginning.</strong></h1>
                <p>Here, Laland begins to explore one of the (if not the) most important topics of the book, social learning. Importantly, copying between animals is less about finding what is ineffective, but what is good and healthy. <br>The problems with social learning certaintly do not outweigh the positives, but become ever more important with human interaction. Animals are so ingrained in the outcomes of their copying, that they are inevitably stubborn to change the ways of all of their peers. When combined with humanity caused climate change, this can create extinctions. <br> <br> Copying in nature, especially related to predators, is not about the fear of being eaten, but of the fear itself. This can lead to being scared of harmless things, and reluctancy to give up detrimental habits. </p>

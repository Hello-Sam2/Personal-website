            <h1><strong>Meditations on<br>Meditation </strong></h1>
            <p>What does it mean to be mindful? What is a "meditative experience?" How do you start meditating? What do you learn about when you meditate? Through meditating? These are the sorts of questions we will be answering.

                <h1>You just gotta start</h1>
                <img style="align-items: center;" src="images/streak.PNG">
                <h3 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: slategray;">I guess I <em>technically</em>haven't been meditating for a month. I think that's close enough. </h3>
                <p>The hardest part of trying something new is beginning. You'll know that if you've ever written an essay in your life. You need some way to start incredibly easily and cheaply. I had a bit of a headstart because I had meditated once before, despite unsuccessfully. But, when this incredible sixty day free trial to <a href="headspace.com">headspace</a>came out, I knew I couldn't miss this oppuritunity. Not convinced to want to try guided meditation? Well, I hope to convince you of its usefulness by the end of this article. </p>

                <h1>The F*** is Mindfulness?</h1>
                <p>Meditation is truly a <em>mindful</em>experience. But, what does that even mean. In my humble opinion, being mindful is a synonym to being present, or in other terms, applying the principles of meditation to your entire life. I.e.: Not making harsh assumptions, not craving, and most importantly, being present during the activity, not worrying about the past or the future. Being mindful throughout all of life can easily be seen as a form of enlightenment, so don't expect to find it on the first day of meditation. But, even the Buddha had to start somewhere. So, how do you meditate?</p>

                <h1>Meditation: A How To Guide</h1>
                <p>"The point [of meditation] is not to get rid of thoughts, but to see their true meaning." - Pema Chodron. A common misconception is that meditation is about getting rid of thought, though it is quite the opposite. The point of meditation is to actually coax thoughts into coming into view, and then letting them and the meaning "wash" over you per se. Chodron's method of meditation is very simple on the surface, whenever you get lost in thought, whether it was an idea or a five minute daydream, just label it as, "thinking" and go back to your breath. Did I mention the breath yet? No. Well, you can use anything as an object of focus during meditation though the breath is the perfect vehicle because it is simultaneously the easiest and hardest thing to control. If these seems too daunting for the moment, don't worry, there's another way to begin! </p>

                <h1>That Other Way</h1>
                <p>Is guided meditation. Wait, but doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of focusing on the breath if someone is talking to you? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, it is so much easier than going straight into sitting in silence, which can take time to get used to considering the hustle culture of the day. But, it is almost impossible, in my opinion, to have a true meditative experience with someone in the background because you always waiting for something. To be present one must relinquish a grip on the past and future (which one can never truly have, anyways). And, if you start a ten minute guided meditation, at the very least there is a small thought of waiting for the moment when the voice comes back on to tell you it's over. Despite this, I do consider guided meditation to be incredibly useful, especially for those more experienced in the art. So, you think you're ready to ditch the guidance? What should you aim for? Well, the answer is nothing.</p>

                <h1>Your first meditative experience</h1>
                <p>I'm sure you've daydreamed before. During the daydream there's a sense of not being where you are despite the fact that you aren't moving. The key here is that it's very hard to consiously return to that dream state. This is the main issue with having a goal for meditation. For one, having a goal means you are looking forward to something, which already defeats the purpose, but furthermore, it's not possible (at least for most people) to go into the meditative experience. You need to build up a routine where by the end you end up in the awareness yet thoughtlessness of meditation. And even with a perfect routine, sometimes your mind is racing, and you just can't become truly aware. And that's okay. 
                </p>
                <h1>So What Are You Supposed to Get from Meditating?</h1>
                <p>Absolutely nothing. You aren't <em>supposed</em> to get anything from meditating. That's the one takeaway I need you to get, other then to start meditating, expectations defeat the purpose. Everyone's experience is completely different, I can tell you my thoughts, but if you don't have anywhere near the same journey that's completely okay. Once I had a week of guided meditation, I felt that I was ready to experiment with just sitting in silence. In my experience, there are some days where you reach a deeper meditative state, one where the thoughts melt away and you can just be present. But, no matter how I hard I try, how devoted I am to the routine of meditation, I cannot force this outcome. And this displays the whole point of meditation. Never to force anything, no removal of thoughts, just to be present.  </p>

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>Being present is not just something to be done during meditation, it is--and must be--done throughout all aspects of life. This is why I encourage you to start being present in any small way you can. If that's meditation, great, but if that's just taking out the earbuds while on a walk once a week, that's good. Even better, experiment with noticing ever time you stand up and sit-down. See how many times you remember to be present, and have fun with it. Don't be too stressed out when five hours later you realized you forgot completely about this goal. Just remember there is no one end goal, everyone's path to enlightenment is different, and since the path is greated by every action you take, simultaneously the end goal is different. Really most importantly, have fun or you're meditation journey shall end up being very short. -SB</p>

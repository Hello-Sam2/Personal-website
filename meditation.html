            <h1><strong>Meditations on<br>Meditation </strong></h1>
            <p>What does it mean to be mindful? What is a "meditative experience?" How do you start meditating? What do you learn about when you meditate? Through meditating? These are the sorts of questions we will be answering.

                <img src="images/streak.PNG">
                <h3 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: slategray;">I guess I <em>technically</em>haven't been meditating for a month. I think that's close enough. </h3>
                <p>The hardest part of trying something new is beginning. You'll know that if you've ever written an essay in your life. You need some way to start incredibly easily and cheaply. I had a bit of a headstart because I had meditated once before, despite unsuccessfully. But, when this incredible sixty day free trial to <a href="headspace.com">headspace</a>came out, I knew I couldn't miss this oppuritunity. Not convinced to want to try guided meditation? Well, I hope to convince you of its usefulness by the end of this article. </p>

                <h1>The F*** is Mindfulness?</h1>
                <p>Meditation is truly a <em>mindful</em>experience. But, what does that even mean. In my humble opinion, being mindful is a synonym to being present, or in other terms, applying the principles of meditation to your entire life. I.e.: Not making harsh assumptions, not craving, and most importantly, being present during the activity, not worrying about the past or the future. Being mindful throughout all of life can easily be seen as a form of enlightenment, so don't expect to find it on the first day of meditation. But, even the Buddha had to start somewhere. So, how do you meditate?</p>

                <h1>Meditation: A How To Guide</h1>
                <p>"The point [of meditation] is not to get rid of thoughts, but to see their true meaning." - Pema Chodron. A common misconception is that meditation is about getting rid of thought, though it is quite the opposite. The point of meditation is to actually coax thoughts into coming into view, and then letting them and the meaning "wash" over you per se. Chodron's method of meditation is very simple on the surface, whenever you get lost in thought, whether it was an idea or a five minute daydream, just label it as, "thinking" and go back to your breath. Did I mention the breath yet? No. Well, you can use anything as an object of focus during meditation though the breath is the perfect vehicle because it is simultaneously the easiest and hardest thing to control. If these seems too daunting for the moment, don't worry, there's another way to begin! </p>

                <h1>That Other Way</h1>
                <p>Is guided meditation. Wait, but doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of focusing on the breath if someone is talking to you? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, it is so much easier than going straight into sitting in silence, which can take time to get used to considering the hustle culture of the day. But, it is almost impossible, in my opinion, to have a true meditative experience with someone in the background because you always waiting for something. To be present one must relinquish a grip on the past and future (which one can never truly have, anyways). And, if you start a ten minute guided meditation, at the very least there is a small thought of waiting for the moment when the voice comes back on to tell you it's over. Despite this, I do consider guided meditation to be incredibly useful, especially for those more experienced in the art. So, you think you're ready to ditch the guidance? What should you aim for? Well, the answer is nothing.</p>

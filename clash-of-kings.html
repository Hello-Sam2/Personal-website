        <h1>📚Summary:</h1>
        <p>Following immediately after the previous book, A Clash of Kings dives deep into the "world war" that's going on. It is every one against each other, with no tactics out of the handbook. Whether from a mysterious sorceress or just plain murder, A Clash of Kings reveals what happens not just to the ruling class, but to the peasants, when Kings collide.</p>
        
        <h1>🔎How I discovered the book:</h1>
        <p>Of course I had to read it after Game of Thrones.</p>

        <h1>🧠My Thoughts:</h1>
        <p>It was not as good as Game of Thrones. The problem there is the standards are all messed up. Just because the book isn't one of the best ever written does not mean it's bad. This one still had me up late and constantly thinking of the intricate politics of Westeros. 9,000 stars. </p>  
        
        <h1>👍What I liked about it?</h1>
        <p>I loved what Martin did with Arya, and the intricate politics of King's Landing discovered by Tyrion were incredible. The amount of possibility is incredible and though he did give the readers a twist, it wasn't so outlandish as to annoy everyone.  </p>
        
        <h1>👎What I didn't like about it?</h1>
        <p>Honestly, I didn't love the introduced chapters with Theon and Davos. I warmed up to them by the end, but they were certainly not as good as Arya or Jon. </p>

        <h1>🤔Who would like it?</h1>
        <p>This is epic fantasy at it's best. It might not be the best place to start, but anyone into fantasy is guaranteed to love the series. You just have to be open to reading a long book. </p>

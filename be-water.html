            <h1><strong>Be Water, My Friend<br> Main Points</strong></h1>
            <p>This book has changed the way I look at life in general. I understand the martial arts implications of Bruce's philosophy, but the book can also easily apply the philosophy to any aspect of life.

                <h1>üåäIntroduction:</h1>
                <p>Be Water, My Friend is a quote from Bruce Lee. He is referencing the idea of becoming water in all aspects in life as though water may be calm and flowing through all places, it can also crash. The book written by Shannon Lee, Bruce's daughter, has ten chapters all of which have many sub-sections, but, for clarity I shall provide at least one point from each chapter (though in reality more because there are so many important things!), hope you enjoy and especially <em>apply</em>these ideas to your life.</em></p>

                <h1>Chapter 1: Tension, and Extremes</h1>
                <p>One of the first points of the book is having appropriate tension. What does this mean? Well, if you were always too relaxed, an oppuritunity might pass by, and you wouldn't be ready to take it. Water is always ready as Bruce elaborates, </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"...When the floodgates open, we can flow on through."(28)<hr> </blockquote>
                <p>Next is the principle of extremes. Without amazing and terrible experiences, there will never be a happy medium of living life. Shannon uses the example of the misconception of the Yin-Yang symbol. Many interperet it to be Yin <em>and</em>Yang, when in reality, the two sides are both necessary to forming the one whole, and cannot be seperated.</p>

                <h1>üß†Chapter 2: Choiceless Awareness + Related Points</h1>
                <p>The second chapter focuses on a principle called, choicless awareness, which at its very basic means to take in <em>what is</em>without applying emotion or preemptive notions. This connects to perceiving people, not going into it thinking that guy is annoying, but not expecting anything. Furthermore, this perception will not make you solve an issue, but it can't change your mindset on the problem, which opens up new solutions, and is half the battle.</p>

                <h1>üö™Chapter 3: Ignorance & Seeing</h1>
                <p>The third chapter is all about inherent ignorance, centering around your ego. Shannon presents two circumstances for when your ego takes the forfront:"[when you] should do or say something," and when, "your self-worth depends on external circumstances." Another concept is called really seeing, and entails looking where you may have not previously. Whether that is seeing the strength connected to your weakness, or looking for light in the darkness, always expect the unexpected.</p>

                <h1>ü•äChapter 4: Competition</h1>
                <p>In the fourth chapter, Shannon dives her father's mindset on competition. He did not particularly like it for, </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"If you need someone else to be wrong to be okay, are you truly okay?" <hr></blockquote>
                <p>Furthermore, competition focuses solely on the areas where you lack in life, how to bring them up to beat someone else. From this you lose the appreaciation of what you have, and will never be satified with your progress, always looking towards the next objective. In other words, </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"Only you will really ever know whether your life was good for you." (87)<hr></blockquote>

                <h1>üìïChapter 5: The Beginning</h1>
                <p>Chapter five is where Shannon goes into her father's tools for accomplishing his goals, from journaling to affirmations. But, more importantly, she emphasizes the importance of beginning. Some things cannot be planned for and only learned from experience, and, of course, failing. So, just start!</p>

                <h1>üèîChapter 6: The Obstacle [Is the Way]</h1>
                <p>You might not know that Bruce Lee experienced a crippling back injury in the prime of his career. He was presumed by doctors never to walk again and certaintly not to go back to the level of fitness he got to. He of course proved them wrong and went on to perform in Enter the Dragon, but only through dedication and analysis. He used the obstacle to his advantage, and never gave up no matter what he was told.  </p>
                <p>An important concept to keep in mind is not blunting the tools. Shannon describes many ways this happens including, </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"Whether through [pessimism] makes a problem harder, fear stops us from attacking the problem, doubt gives you an excuse not to solve the problem..." (141).<hr></blockquote>

                <h1>üí®Chapter 7: The Problem?</h1>
                <p>Quite often, one can find treat life as if it's just a problem to be solved. There may be problems during life, but sometimes you have to leave them be, especially if you have little power over them (which means you essentially have none. This quote from Bruce explains this excellently,  </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"There is nowhere for man to go out of this world...instead of telling us what the problem is, Zen insists that the whole trouble is just our failure to realize that there is no problem. And, of course, this means that there is no solution either..."(Bruce, 165).</blockquote>

                <h1>üåâChapter 8: Mind The Gap</h1>
                <p>The living void. Impossible right? The point of a void is nothingness, so how could it be alive? Well, the void itself is not alive, no, but you make it so. Every decision you make is filling, and bridging over this gap. Sometimes, the gap seems larger, you tell yourself others will find your idea crazy, sometimes the gap seems tiny, but, it never changes. What changes is how you act when reaching the edge. Depending on your mindset, you can either jump into the oblivion, or step easily over it. Here's a tip from Shannon:</p>
                <blockquote><hr>We must shorten the time between sensing and doing such that thought and action become the oneness of expression..." (178).<hr></blockquote>
                
                <h1>ü§úChapter 9: The Way of the Intercepting Fist</h1>
                <p>Jeet Kune Do. One of the most notable things Bruce Lee ever did was create his own style known as such. It translates to the way of the intercepting fist, but, it was truly just his fully actualized self. What does that mean? Well, it is the full expression of your values in what you do. He believed in inclusion, so he mixed multiple styles together, he believed in action, so he did away with everything unnecessary. Moreover, <em>he became himself</em>.</p>
                <p>So, you can get only so far by taking from others. At a certain point you must sculpt what you've learned to your own liking, or,</p>
                <blockquote><hr>"Add what is essentially your own."</blockquote>

                <h1>üß¨Chapter 10: Life & Death</h1>
                <p>Though his life was short by many measures, he always lived assuming it was the last day of his life. He thought if I had no more time, I would want to act immediately, and so he did. The most important thing I've taken away from this book is this principle. Whenever I think of something mundane, or fun, or annoying, or scary, I want to make progress immediately. If you do this, you will have no regrets as you've done everything you've wanted to do and/or was possible to.</p>

            <h1><strong>Be Water, My Friend<br> Main Points</strong></h1>
            <p>This book has changed the way I look at life in general. I understand the martial arts implications of Bruce's philosophy, but the book can also easily apply the philosophy to any aspect of life.

                <h1>ðŸŒŠIntroduction:</h1>
                <p>Be Water, My Friend is a quote from Bruce Lee. He is referencing the idea of becoming water in all aspects in life as though water may be calm and flowing through all places, it can also crash. The book written by Shannon Lee, Bruce's daughter, has ten chapters all of which have many sub-sections, but, for clarity I shall provide at least one point from each chapter (though in reality more because there are so many important things!), hope you enjoy and especially <em>apply</em>these ideas to your life.</em></p>

                <h1>Chapter 1: Tension, and Extremes</h1>
                <p>One of the first points of the book is having appropriate tension. What does this mean? Well, if you were always too relaxed, an oppuritunity might pass by, and you wouldn't be ready to take it. Water is always ready as Bruce elaborates, </p>
                <blockquote><hr>"...When the floodgates open, we can flow on through."(28) </blockquote>
                <p>Next is the principle of extremes. Without amazing and terrible experiences, there will never be a happy medium of living life. Shannon uses the example of the misconception of the Yin-Yang symbol. Many interperet it to be Yin <em>and</em>Yang, when in reality, the two sides are both necessary to forming the one whole, and cannot be seperated.</p>

                <h1>ðŸ§ Chapter 2: Choiceless Awareness + Related Points</h1>
                <p>The second chapter focuses on a principle called, choicless awareness, which at its very basic means to take in <em>what is</em>without applying emotion or preemptive notions. This connects to perceiving people, not going into it thinking that guy is annoying, but not expecting anything. Furthermore, this perception will not make you solve an issue, but it can't change your mindset on the problem, which opens up new solutions, and is half the battle.</p>

                <h1>ðŸšªChapter 3: Ignorance & Seeing</h1>
                <p>The third chapter is all about inherent ignorance, centering around your ego. Shannon presents two circumstances for when your ego takes the forfront:"[when you] should do or say something," and when, "your self-worth depends on external circumstances."</p>

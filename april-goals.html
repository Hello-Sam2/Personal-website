            <h1><strong>Sam's April 2021<br> Goal Update</strong></h1>
            <p>Wow, we're halfway through March already I cannot believe it. I'm still ticking along on my goals, but here is where I'm at now, and where I'm planning on being by next month.
            </p>
            
            <hr color="orange">

            <h1>Notes:</h1>
            <p>Essentially, the main groups on this list are the value goals, and the sub-topics are the goal-outcomes. </p>
            <p>I am going to add an action point for each outcome, and update on them next month when I hopefully have finished them!</p>
           
           
            <img>
            <p>These are my current goals, of both varieties. </p>

            <h1>Learning & Improvement</h1>
            <h2>ü§îCreating a "LifeOS" in Notion</h2>
            <p>Since last month, I've done a hard look at my goals, and selected only which ones I find helpful to me at this moment. Since you know from my monthly review system(which you should click here to check out), I split my goals into value and outcomes:</p> 
            <p>I wouldn't say I've changed the system itself, but I'm certaintly more intentional about what I actually care about right now. Mindset is half the battle.</p>
            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>Transfer all of your tasks/action items, so you don't forget them, into the notion database. </p>

            <h2>üìïFollowing the 5 Hour Rule</h2>
            <p>I was considering taking this off of my goals entirely because it has become so ingrained into my life. But, I was listening to a podcast episode, I believe one of the Not-Overthinkg Podcast, where the guest was talking about core values. Essentially, writing them down and reminding yourself will instill them farther. So, I created a new priority, always, and now it always shows up on the bottom of my goal outcomes. </p>

            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>Find another non-fiction book to learn from.</p>
           
            <h1>‚ô•Health & Fitness</h1>
            <h2>ü•ãGetting my 2nd Degree Black Belt</h2>
            <p>Welp, I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit dissapointed on where this went. I joined the track team (as I'll talk about later), and because of that, I can't really practice martial arts enough to be ready for the test in June. So, this means I will be postponing the test to later in the summer.</p>
            <p>I am quite sad that I will have to push it back more, but I wanted to "seek discomfort(which we'll get to later)" and take this oppuritunity to try a different sport.</p>
            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>Don't forget your martial arts, otherwise it'll be much harder to get back on track.</p>
            <h2>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRunning</h2>
            <p>As I referenced before, I joined the track team. I did this for a few reasons, one being the above, another being to get better at it, and a final being to have more fun while doing it. When running alone, it is just so much harder to enjoy, but while running with others, you can get much more motivation, and forget it is a hard physical activity. </p>
            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>Run a timed 5K (and hopefully get sub-25).</p>

            <h1>‚õ∞Seeking Discomfort</h1>
            <p>Whatever you want to call this, a mantra, a value, a goal, it's still important. Life just ain't interesting unless you're exiting your comfort zone, and I'm hoping to exert this through all my other goals. In my study of Bruce Lee's philosophy, he references the final stage of actualization, which is being wholly yourself. There is always an emphasis on acting and not second-guessing. Not wasting energy on what might go wrong.</p>
            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>When you think to do something, do it. Whether that is washing the dishes or texting someone, it doesn't matter.</p>

            <h1>üñ•Personal Brand</h1>
            <p>This is ticking along both on my blog and newsletter, which I'm really just trying to grow at the moment. I'm good with where I am, and just wanna keep building up a content block so once I grow it more, the experience is already there. </p>
            <h1>‚úåÔ∏èRelationships</h1>
            <p>I've been focusing especially this month on talking to more people that you might know less well. It's very important to catch up, and hang out with those who you are close with, but it's just important to get to know more people, so you can eventually become closer to them.</p>
            <p>Whether this is someone you know slightly, or someone you always see but don't even know their name, it's still good to at least start a conversation, who knows what could happen?</p>
            <h3>Action point:</h3>
            <p>Talk to 2 people who you don't know (not like, in the street, but, at school or in your building).</p>
           
            <h1>üß†Final thoughts</h1>
            <p>This is certaintly not an expansive list of all of my goals, there are some which I shall not disclose. But, I think this gives you a general idea of where I'm aiming right now. I would love for you to tune in next month to make sure I made progress (especially on the black belt goal), and if not, feel free to shoot me an email!<br> -<br> Sam</p>
            <p>P.S. I really want to know about the formatting of this website, especially the font, and if you think it can be improved. I'm trying to work on my sense of design, which is extremely important for everything on the internet. So, if you have any ideas, please shoot me an email at 23Samuelb@lrei.org <br> Thanks!</p>

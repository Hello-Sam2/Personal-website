        <h1>📚Summary:</h1>
        <p>It's about the world of the Seven Kingdoms, where we follow multiple characters in the story notably the family of Lord Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and old Kingdom of the North. He has 5 children, Baby Rickson, Arya, who rejects all sorts of royal duties, and her sister Sansa, the model princess. There is also Bran, the second eldest son, and Robb, the heir to Winterfell. There is also Jon Snow, the King's bastard. The story progresses to follow Tyrion Lannister, the imp, and the King of the Seven Kingdoms, Robert Baratheon. Meanwhile, Daenerys, sister to Viserys, the last of the Targareyans who were King of the Seven Kingdoms for hundreds of years until recently deposed, is gaining power in a faraway land. From the way he intricately combines first-person accounts  to murder and history; it is much too intricate and awesome to display here. Go read it! </p>
        
        <h1>🔎How I discovered the book:</h1>
        <p>I discovered it in the school library after of course hearing of it many times in the past. I had never seen the HBO Series, and I had previously regarded the books as quite long, but, after reading many other books, I decided it was time. </p>

        <h1>🧠My Thoughts:</h1>
        <p>Wow. I will say, this could be one of the best fantasy books, no, books I've ever read. The way Martin engulfs you in the world of the Seven Kingdoms, the suspense, and the way he easily flows through each character's point of views is incredible. 10,000 Stars. </p>  
        
        <h1>👍What I liked about it?</h1>
        <p>The complexity of the entire world he created is incredible to me. Every single character has their own stories revolving around them, and the way he intricately flows through time and details makes the story feel ever more real. </p>
        
        <h1>👎What I didn't like about it?</h1>
        <p>At first, the start of the book was a bit boring. But, it is quite fun to read it again at the end of the book with the different point of view of knowing what it all meant.</p>

        <h1>🤔Who would like it?</h1>
        <p>If you've liked any fantasy in the past, and can read long books, you're guaranteed to love it.</p>

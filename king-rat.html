        <h1>Summary:</h1>
        <p>It's about American, English, and Australian POW's in a camp in Singapore held by the Japanese. The story centers around the King, an American who is smart with trading, though it is illegal, and Peter Marlowe, an innocent Englishman who fiercely believes in the English Class System. The supporting characters enrich the story with many subplots most importantly through Grey, an English officer keen on ratting out the King for, something. Whether it is through a hidden radio or outside the tall fences, subplots create the suspense of the story! 
        <h1>🔎How I discovered the book:</h1>
        <p>After reading Shogun and Tai-Pan, I skipped ahead somewhat in the Asian Saga.</p>

        <h1>🧠My Thoughts:</h1>
        <p>IThe first hundred or two pages were a bit slow in my opinion. But the ending has so many deeper meanings and truly brings the storylines to a close.  
        
        <h1>👍What I liked about it?</h1>
        <p>So many intricate characters that all interact. The flashes towards other people are also interesting through the intersections.</p>
        
        <h1>👎What I didn't like about it?</h1>
        <p>It was sort of boring for the beginning, even in my opinion. </p>

        <h1>🤔Who would like it?</h1>
        <p>If you like other's of James Clavell's books, then you might like it. Especially if you are interested in WWII history and the war in Asia.</p>
